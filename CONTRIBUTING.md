Thank you for joining me to bring this idea to life. It's a privilege to work with you. Yes you! There are a few things I want you to note:

-   it's okay for every thing to be new to you. You'll get the hang of it as we go on.

-   your opinion is important. So if you have a better way of doing stuff please let me know.

-   this is the work of God and there will definitely be a reward for it on the last day. So give it your best shot

First Task: Learn the following technologies

-   Git (if you don't already know it) is a great version control tool that we would definitely be using so that we can collaborate. It's a bit confusing with the terms and terminologies but you'll get the hang of it once you practice. Check out this resourceinclude link to resources

-   Tailwind CSS: it is a great css framework and we'll be using it for this project and they have a great tutorial on thier website - https://tailwindcss.com

-   Git Workflows. Here we will be learning to use Git to work well with teams so

Second Task: Clone the project repository and go through the design files. We will be bringing those amazing design to life.

Lastly: I'll be breaking the project into smaller tasks and assigning them to you.

We will have deadlines. Don't worry I know we all have things we are doing so they won't be so strict.

Remember if you have any issues at all feel free to ask no man is an island let's all learn from each other
